# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

In this pproject, the main objective is to find the best stock market prediction system to predict the financial
prices of the stock market. This project implements a time series analysis approach that combines with
machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques. Algorithms that are regression-based such as
linear regression and support vector regression are implemented throughout this project. Moreover, time
series forecasting such as Long Short Term Memory and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average are
also used in this experiment. Datasets from Yahoo Finance are collected and preprocessed to be fitted into
these models. Historical data includes twelve months and five years of data for Tesco and Sainsbury are
used for the experiment. In addition, the target variable is the close price since it is determined for profit
and loss analysis. Hence, the project is attempting to forecast a close price at a certain time based on the
historical stock prices using different kinds of machine learning models.
